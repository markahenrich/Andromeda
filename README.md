# Andromeda
An iOS app for NASA's open API's starting with Astronomy Picture of The Day.

### Purpose
I am building this app to demonstrate my skills in mobile devlopment in a topic that interests me. I am also using this as an opportunity to demonstrate utilizing multiple languages in a single Xcode project, however, it's certainly not necessary for the scale of this app. I plan to peridiocally update the app with new knowledge and technologies as my knowledge and skill in iOS development matures. 

### Technologies
Swift, UiKit, Obejctive-C, C/C++
